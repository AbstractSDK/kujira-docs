# ðŸŽ‰ Genesis Validator Allocation

Kujira has smoothly rebounded from Terra's collapse. We relaunched in six weeks by building and building and building. That being said, this would have never been possible without a staunch group of fearless validators who weathered the launch of our new blockchain with us.

As a thank you to every validator that has borne the risk with us we have decided to compensate them generously while respecting our central values of sustainability and integrity. As a part of this move, the Kujira team has delegated 200,000 KUJI tokens indefinitely to each of our 75 genesis validator that were in the active set when the Kujira mainnet first launched for a total of 15 million KUJI.

These delegations allow all Kujira genesis validators to generate extra revenue indefinitely for as long as they continue to support and validate on the Kujira chain. For example, for a genesis validator with 5% commission and a KUJI staking APR of 10%, this 200,000 KUJI delegation would correspond to 200000\*5%\*10% \~ 1000 KUJI worth of extra funding yearly. As the ecosystem grows and KUJI increases in value, genesis validators see greater rewards for their contributions to the Kujira ecosystem.

Sometimes genesis validators may fail to uphold their duties in managing the chain. They may get slashed multiple times due to low budget tools; they may try to take advantage of the community; they may act in a way that goes against the community underlying driving values for the Kujira chain. In extreme cases, we may remove our team delegations from a genesis validator at our own discretion. This is a last resort and we have not removed the vast majority of our delegations.

Over time, new entrants may join the validator set as the chain matures, as a part of this our main mechanism may evolve. That being said, the [Kujira Senate](../dapps-and-infrastructure/senate.md) will probably pay a more pivotal role moving forward in making such decision. &#x20;
