# ðŸ’° How to Deposit Assets into the Ecosystem

To acquire KUJI and/or engage in these different activities on the Kujira blockchain, it is first necessary to move funds onto the network itself. The easiest steps to do so depend on your starting point. That being said, every user moving funds to Kujira will need to establish an account on a Kujira network compatible wallet in order to utilize the blockchain. The Kujira wallet will be the premier wallet for the Kujira network as soon as it launches; however, in the meantime the Leap and Keplr wallets are available.

After your wallet is setup, you can then fund your wallet directly by moving funds [directly from other chains or centralized exchanges](https://medium.com/team-kujira/how-to-buy-kuji-on-fin-485172f23eea) using the [axelar bridge](https://satellite.money/). Or you can deposit funds directly into Kujira from your bank account using [Kado Money](../dapps-and-infrastructure/basics.md#funding-your-wallet-using-kado).&#x20;
