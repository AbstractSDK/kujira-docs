# ðŸ—¼ The Kujira Senate

The Kujira Senate is a governance structure for the Kujira blockchain that aims to support the stability and growth of the ecosystem, facilitate validating on the platform, and represent the values of the community. It is composed of up to nine experts elected by the staking community and is accountable, transparent, and democratic.

The Senate is responsible for casting votes on proposals related to requests for grants from the community fund and will review and decide on the Kujira Community Pool's budget. It aims to enhance decentralization by amplifying the voices of elected representatives and allowing those with knowledge, experience, and the trust of the community to have an impact.&#x20;

The Senate will be implemented through two new smart contracts and the next steps include building out the technical infrastructure and onboarding the first Senators. Find more information [here](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/senate.md).
