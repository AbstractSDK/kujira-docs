# ðŸ’° Treasury

The Treasury is a basket of different tokens that the [Kujira Senate](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/senate.md) can use to fund projects, partnerships, and improve the Kuijra network by working directly for the community.

The community fund accumulates funds as 5% of network fees (both from gas and transactions on our first party dApps and from revenue share on all third party Kujira dApps). These funds will transferred periodically to the treasury via governance. This allows the treasury to slowly refill and function as a sustainable entity over time, especially as network usage and adoption increase.&#x20;

Since fees on the Kujira network are paid using the in-demand network assets actually being traded or bidded on, the treasury accumulates multiple distinct assets. This gives it the flexibility to be diversified and resilient over time.
