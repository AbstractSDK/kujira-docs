# âš” Discord Governance Forum

The Discord Governance Forum is an important platform for the Kujira community to discuss new project proposals and ideas for the Kujira chain. It is also a place where community members can communicate their views and engage with the Kuijra Senate about project fund proposals.

The forum provides a democratic space for members of the Kujira community to discuss and collaborate on proposals before they are formally submitted for governance. This helps ensure that proposals are well-thought-out and have the support of the community before they are put to a vote.

To participate in the Discord Governance Forum, you will need to join the Kujira Discord server and join the appropriate channels. There you can discuss proposals with other members of the community and provide feedback to the Senate. It's a great way to get involved in the decision-making process and help shape the future of the Kujira chain.
