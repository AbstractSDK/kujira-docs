# âš” Discord Governance Forum

The Discord Governance Forum is a democratic space for our community to discuss new project proposals and ideas for the Kujira chain before proposals are submitted for governance. It is also an avenue for the community to communicate their stances to and correspond with the Kuijra Senate about project fund proposals.&#x20;
