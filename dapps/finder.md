# Finder

The Finder webpage is where you can track addresses, transactions, validators and more on Kujira. Before using it, be sure to toggle to your desired network in the upper right corner, whether testnet or mainnet. To bookmark an address, simply search it and click on the bookmark sign in the upper right corner. To view saved addresses, click the bookmark button directly beside the search bar. Try it out for yourself at [https://finder.kujira.app/kaiyo-1/](https://finder.kujira.app/kaiyo-1/).
