# ðŸŽ¶ Discord

The Kujira Discord is a community hub containing many channels for different types of activity. We will detail a few aspects of the Discord below though much can be found out simply by exploring our Discord which is contained at [https://discord.gg/teamkujira](https://discord.gg/teamkujira).

Along with our Telegram, Discord is the primary means of directly communicating with the team (and experienced & friendly chat moderators), asking for support on technical issues, (on occasion polite requests or recommendations for new features or modifications to existing features), engaging with the community in a relatively informal setting, or hearing the latest announcements from the team before they go live anywhere else. The easiest way to request for support on our Discord is to create a Support Ticket. Further, details below. Important note: on Discord for most crypto projects there are many scammers who impersonate team members & moderators and direct message users who ask for help/support in chats to target them for hacks via social engineering. Team members will never direct message you first. If they message you in private, it will only be after letting you know that they will do so first in chat. Kujira Team members have the role Team next to their name when they send messages in any of the Kujira Discord channels and other moderators will have Admin, Moderator, or Community Moderator roles when they send messages in the chat. _**It is generally recommended that you message moderators or team members yourself first after they ask you to private message them in one of the main chats**_ as pretenders can still attempt to message you in private to deceive you.

### Roles

Roles are used on the Kujira Discord to group community members and assign different permissions.&#x20;

### Verify

Anyone can participate in the Kujira Discord after a simple verification process. It may be necessary to temporarily enable direct messages from unknown accounts as a part of the verification process.

### Main Chat

The Main chat channels are places for people to discuss certain topics and/or socialize. Discord easily allows for multi-thread discussions across separate channels and this is where the experience shines.
