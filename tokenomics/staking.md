# Staking

Staking $KUJI with a Kujira validator will earn you a basket of apex assets over time. All fees that are collected are paid to stakers through our validators.

Kujira does not rely on inflationary tokens in order to incentivise staking. Revenue (including gas) from Kujiraâ€™s internal dApps such as ORCA and FIN is sent back to stakers, as well as a portion of revenue from each external protocol that launches on the chain.
