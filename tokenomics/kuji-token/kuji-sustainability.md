# ðŸ‘¨ðŸŒ¾ ðŸ‘¨ðŸŒ¾ KUJI Sustainability

Since KUJI is not an inflationary asset and relies on adoption of its decentralized applications and products to generate fees, KUJI is sustainable. It does not rely on a Ponzi like structure to reward stakers in KUJI printed out of thin air. Stakers are rewarded based on KUJI (and other tokens) paid as fees on Kujira dApps such as FIN. This allows KUJI to be sustainable without needing to pivot its mechanism and we as developers can simply concentrate on building out the best products possible, fostering a strong community, and bringing high integrity to everything we do.&#x20;
