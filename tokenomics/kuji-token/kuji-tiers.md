# ðŸ¥‡ KUJI Tiers

On BLUE, FIN, and ORCA, there are icons at the top right corner of each app:  <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt="" data-size="line">&#x20;

The symbols light up corresponding to the amount of KUJI a user with a connected wallet has staked in total across all Kujira validators on Kujira mainnet.

The first KUJI staking tier to light up the leftmost symbol is 500 KUJI.

The second KUJI staking tier to light up the middle symbol is 5000 KUJI.

The third KUJI staking tier to light up the rightmost symbol is 50000 KUJI.

What significance do these symbols have? And will any other symbols appear? To be continued...&#x20;
