# ðŸŒ³ Sustainability

Sustainability is a core value at Kujira. We believe that decentralized finance needs a strong and resilient foundation to survive and thrive. That's why we've prioritized sustainability in all of our products and initiatives.

* We've avoided inflationary incentives such as airdrops and liquidity pool rewards, as we believe they can harm the long-term health of the Kujira ecosystem.
* Instead, we've focused on building high-quality, fee-charging dApps that generate real yield from genuine demand for our products.
* We've minimized dApp fees to make them more accessible to users, while still ensuring a sustainable revenue model.
* 100% of our dApp revenue is shared with KUJI stakers, and all staking rewards from our 13.8 million KUJI staked with genesis validators are redistributed back to stakers. This helps to increase the yield for everyone in the Kujira ecosystem.
