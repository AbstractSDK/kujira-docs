# üìñ The Kujira Commandments



1. We are honest and transparent. We like to underpromise and overdeliver.
2. As the Kuijra platform expands, aspiring projects & teams should embrace a real, sustainable business model. We encourage sustainable fees based on real user volume and/or real revenue generation. Business models with inflationary tokens are better suited for other chains instead.&#x20;
3. We want builders who care about their community. Everyone deserves to be a whale.&#x20;
4. Kujira is a supportive community. The core team and our community members will help promote, market, and bring liquidity to projects building on Kujira.&#x20;
5. Kujira protects its community. Rather than ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù projects, we want valuable projects that are built to last.&#x20;
6. Cooperation between our dApps and teams building on Kujira is a must. We are in this together. If we do not stick together, we will not succeed. We are a small platform and need to build network effects and community collectively. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs play nice‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo PVP‚Äù are our mottos.&#x20;
7. We are open-minded. We are interested in new ideas that others may quickly dismiss.
8. &#x20;The Kujira community is collaborative and sees crypto as a growing pie - not a zero sum game.&#x20;
9. We believe in providing value over incumbency. We are not afraid to challenge the status quo and embrace our own systems as long as we think they are better.&#x20;
10. We want to bring the next billion people into DeFi. To that end, we want to create real, valuable technology that gets adopted. Rather than focusing on one-off projects, we are eager to work on building synergistic DeFi money legos.
