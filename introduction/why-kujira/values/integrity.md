# ðŸŒŸ Integrity

We pride ourselves on our high integrity in every facet of Kujira.

Perhaps this was demonstrated most strongly when the Terra network collapsed and many constituents were deeply affected. We maintained constant and clear communication with all of our users 24/7 throughout the aftermath of the UST peg collapse.

Four days after the initial depeg, we even released our brand new CLOB dex, FIN, and two days after that, when the Terra chain halted, we [revealed our decision](https://medium.com/team-kujira/the-future-of-kujira-485d43c4729c) to move to our own sovereign Cosmos chain.

We were able to launch the Kujira chain in just six weeks. Within two months of launch, the KUJI tokenâ€™s valuation was already back above pre-depeg levels on Terra.
