# üéÅ Charity

Charity is an important aspect of the Kujira ecosystem. We believe in giving back to others and supporting disadvantaged communities. Our team and community have demonstrated this commitment through various charitable initiatives.

Here are a few examples of our charitable efforts:

* Kujira joined the Angel Alliance, a charity alliance on the Terra blockchain, headed by Angel Protocol. As part of our commitment to charity, we contributed approximately 0.2% of our genesis supply (131000 KUJI) to Angel Protocol. These funds will be used to generate staking revenue for those in need.
* AQUA, a charity DAO building on Kujira, is dedicated to ending the global water crisis. AQUA has decided to airdrop 1.5% of their total supply to KUJI stakers as a show of solidarity with their vision.
* We will be involved in various other charity-focused efforts in the future. Stay tuned for updates.

We are proud of the charitable efforts of our team and community, and we will continue to support and participate in initiatives that align with our values.
