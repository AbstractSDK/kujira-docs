# üéÅ Charity

We care about giving back to others and helping those who are disadvantaged. It underscores an important piece of our underlying ethos. There are numerous examples where the team and others in our community have risen to the occasion and helped others and we are very proud.

Furthermore, back on Terra, Kujira joined the Angel Alliance, a Terra charity alliance that was headed by Angel Protocol at the time. And as part of our commitment to charity, based on the outcome of our second governance vote, we contributed approximately 0.2% of our genesis supply (131000 KUJI) to Angel Protocol, meant to perpetually generate staking revenue for those in need.

More recently, AQUA, a charity DAO, building on [Juno](https://docs.junonetwork.io/juno/readme), dedicated to ending the world water crisis has decided to airdrop 1.5% of their total supply to KUJI stakers. We stand in solidarity with such efforts and happy to cheer on AQUA's vision.

We will be involved in various other charity focused efforts over time. Stay tuned.&#x20;
