# ðŸ“± Ecosystem

Kujira is a blockchain ecosystem driven first and foremost by its suite of synergistic, ground-breaking, and sustainable decentralized applications & infrastructure. Directly built by â€˜Team Kujiraâ€™ is a bevy of high quality products:

* [ORCA](https://orca.kujira.app/), the worldâ€™s first public marketplace for liquidated collateral
* [FIN](https://fin.kujira.app/), Cosmosâ€™ first decentralized, permissionless, 100% on-chain, fair matching order book style                                     token exchange&#x20;

Similar to how [ByteDance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance) and [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\_Office) both quickly built global empires with their application suites, we believe in the effectiveness and value proposition of an appchain. Tight-knit, high-quality decentralized applications are composable primitives. They can be combined to create an emergent variety of attractive financial technologies. That is why we encourage other builders who share our core values to come build their own applications on Kujira. Be part of a movement that wants to revolutionize DeFi, making it more sustainable and accessible to retail investors, while providing informative educational content to raise awareness and allow individuals to be  responsible for their investments.
