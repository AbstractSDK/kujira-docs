# ðŸ“± Appchain Ecosystem

Kujira is a Cosmos blockchain ecosystem driven first and foremost by its suite of synergistic, ground-breaking, and sustainable decentralized applications & infrastructure. Directly built by â€˜Team Kujiraâ€™ is a bevy of high quality products:

$$\bullet$$ [ORCA](https://orca.kujira.app/), the worldâ€™s first public marketplace for liquidated collateral

$$\bullet$$ [FIN](https://fin.kujira.app/), Cosmosâ€™ first decentralized, permissionless, 100% on-chain, fair matching order book style                   $$\space \space \space$$token exchange&#x20;

$$\bullet$$ [BLUE](https://blue.kujira.app/), the heart of the Kujira ecosystem$$-$$a hub containing a KUJI dashboard, KUJI staking, $$\space \space \space \space \space$$$$\space \space \space$$governance voting, KUJI swapping, Kujira Network bridging / IBC'ing, and rewards claiming

$$\bullet$$ [FINDER](https://finder.kujira.app/), a tool to search for present and historical data on the Kujira blockchain

$$\bullet$$ [USK](https://blue.kujira.app/mint), a decentralized over-collateralized stablecoin only backed by uncensorable collateral

$$\bullet$$ [The Kujira Wallet](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/kujira-wallet.md), an upcoming sleek, next generation Cosmos wallet which will be available on $$\space \space \space$$various desktop and mobile platforms

$$\bullet$$ [The Kujira Senate](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/senate.md), a new powerful governance mechanism that will springboard decentralization   $$\space \space \space$$and make Kujira substantially more agile                          &#x20;

Similar to how [ByteDance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance) and [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\_Office) both quickly built global empires with their application suites, we believe in the effectiveness and value proposition of an appchain. Tight-knit, high-quality decentralized applications are composable primitives. They can be combined to create an emergent variety of attractive financial technologies. That is why we encourage other builders who share our core values to come build their own applications on Kujira. Be part of a movement that wants to revolutionize DeFi, making it more sustainable and accessible to retail investors, while providing informative educational content to raise awareness and allow individuals to be  responsible for their investments.
