# üéì Grown-Up DeFi (GUD)

Kujira wants to change DeFi in the following ways:

$$\bullet$$ Decentralized Finance _**CAN**_ be respectable and aboveboard

$$\bullet$$ We will _**NOT**_ advertise large, unrealistic, unsustainable yields&#x20;

$$\bullet$$ We will _**NEVER**_ embrace endlessly inflationary governance tokens that do not derive underlying $$\space \space \space$$value from revenue generation

We, the Kujira team, are a passionate collective dedicated towards harnessing DeFi to create new foundational technologies that revolutionize the global financial system. However, we believe that the space needs to mature in the ways we have outlined above to realize its potential.

The crypto black swan summer of 2022 including the apparent insolvency of [Celsius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius\_Network), [Babel](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/29/babel-finance-lost-280m-trading-customer-funds-report/), and [3AC](https://cointelegraph.com/news/3ac-a-10b-hedge-fund-gone-bust-with-founders-on-the-run); the financial woes of [Voyager](https://dfr.vermont.gov/consumer-alert/voyager-digital-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy) and [BlockFi](https://decrypt.co/105765/blockfi-1-8-billion-open-loans-600-million-exposure-q2); the collapse of [UST](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/the-fall-of-terra-a-timeline-of-the-meteoric-rise-and-crash-of-ust-and-luna/); etc. have clearly demonstrated the dangers of unsustainable DeFi. This space needs a rigorous foundation that will not crumble even as leverage is wiped out of the system.

Proper risk management. Proper underpinning incentives. Proper decentralization. No PVP in-fighting. Community voice. Sustainability. DeFi needs to evolve and as Socrates once said: ‚Äúthe secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.‚Äù

That is why Kujira is built to last. With a long-term view for real-world use, revenue, and sustainability for builders, validators, and users (Kujirans) alike, we aim to be the center of the Grown-Up DeFi revolution.  <img src="https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f40b.svg" alt="üêã" data-size="line">
