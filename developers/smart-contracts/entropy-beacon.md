# ðŸŽ² Entropy Beacon

We give a big thanks to [Entropic Labs](https://entropiclabs.io/beacon/) who are bringing cryptographically verifiable on-chain randomness to Kujira.

Their Entropy Beacon is a decentralized source of randomness for blockchain developers that provides secure random number generation in trustless on-chain environments, the first to do so on Cosmos based blockchains.&#x20;

Let's cover a few main aspects of the Entropy Beacon below:

### On-chain Entropy&#x20;

It is currently impossible to generate completely unpredictable random numbers on-chain. Beacon intends to provide a secure, unpredictable, cheap random number generator.

### Incentivized Submissions

Using a bounty model for on-chain entropy requests, Beacon encourages entropy submitters to engage in free-market competition, minimizing overall fees in a decentralized manner.

### Streamlined Development

Beacon provides the most comfortable developer experience of any existing randomness solution, with no complex tokenomics and subscription models, and an ergonomic API for interacting with the system.

### Enabling Next-Gen dApps

An on-chain entropy beacon opens up hundreds of previously unachievable usecases. Lottery systems, tamper-proof giveaways, complex DeFi games, and countless others all require the decentralized generation of secure random numbers.

### How it works

Beacon uses VRF Cryptography to enforce generated random numbers are verifiably unbiased. A more detailed explanation can be found[ here](https://entropiclabs.io/beacon/docs/how-it-works/) in Entropic Labs's docs.

### Quickstart

For developers looking to develop contracts that utilize the Entropy Beacon, Entropic Labs's docs have a substantive explanation covering everything you need to know from start to finish right [here](https://entropiclabs.io/beacon/docs/quickstart/).

### Integration

Furthermore, for developers looking to integrate the Entropy Beacon into existing smart contracts, Entropic Labs's docs also have a substantive explanation on this topic that you can find [here](https://entropiclabs.io/beacon/docs/integration/).&#x20;
