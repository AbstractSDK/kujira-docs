# Token Factory

The Token Factory allows you to create your own native denoms, as recognised by the Cosmos SDK Bank Module.&#x20;

This allows your protocol to issue its own token, without needing to support the CW20 standard. It means that all tokens on the Kujira network are compatible as gas-fee payments, and can be collected as protocol revenue and distributed to KUJI stakers.&#x20;
