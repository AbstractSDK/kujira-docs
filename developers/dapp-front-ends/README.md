# ðŸŽ› dApp Front Ends

## Overview

Our dApps containing sensitive information that are part of the magic secret sauce that allows Kujira's products and infrastructure to be sustainable for our stakers and run at such a high level of quality. As a result, we have decided to start out by closed sourcing our various contracts temporarily. That being said, we are planning to slowly open-source our contracts.&#x20;

We have a repository of anything open-source in our Github: [https://github.com/Team-Kujira](https://github.com/Team-Kujira)

In this section, we will focus on the aspects of our dApps that are being open-sourced over time. &#x20;
