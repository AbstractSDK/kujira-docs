# ðŸ“‹ Listing tokens on FIN

FIN offers a user interface at https://fin.kujira.app/listing that allows community members to propose the launch of a new token pair on the FIN platform. In order to use this feature, you must have a Sonar or Keplr wallet and be connected.

To create a proposal, you will need to select a base asset and a quote asset for the proposed token pair. The base asset is the asset that is being traded, while the quote asset is the asset being used to price the base asset. For example, if the base asset is KUJI and the quote asset is USK, then the price of KUJI would be quoted in USK.

After you have submitted your proposal, it will enter the deposit phase. During this phase, a minimum deposit must be provided by one or more addresses before the proposal can move on to the voting stage. It is important to note that not all tokens may be eligible for listing on FIN.

After a proposal passes community governance, the team will create a token pair UI on FIN and an initial phase of limit order buys and sells will take place to gather initial liquidity. Once sufficient liquidity is placed, trading will begin.
