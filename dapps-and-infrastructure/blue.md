# ðŸ”· BLUE

BLUE is your all-in-one dashboard for the Kujira ecosystem. Here, you can bond [KUJI,](../tokenomics/kuji-token/) vote on governance, swap KUJI, bridge to the Kujira network, and claim rewards. This is the hub of the Kujira protocol, where you can shape its future through governance and earn a portion of Kujira's revenue by staking KUJI.

## Dashboard

The BLUE dashboard provides key analytics for the Kujira blockchain, including:

* KUJI price
* Fully diluted value (FDV) of KUJI
* Total liquid supply of KUJI
* KUJI annual percentage rate (APR) over a 30-day range
* Current block height
* Average block time
* Total number of Kujira network transactions
* Inflation percentage
* Token release schedule
* Personal amount of staked KUJI
* Graphical breakdown of total KUJI supply, including the treasury

The KUJI price on the BLUE dashboard is sourced from Coin Gecko's API. The FDV of the KUJI token is calculated as the maximum supply of KUJI tokens after token vesting is finished, multiplied by the current KUJI token price. The liquid supply refers to the unstaked portion of the circulating KUJI supply that is not locked up in a smart contract. The current block height represents the total number of blocks produced by the Kujira blockchain. The average block time is the average amount of time it takes to produce a new block. The number of Kujira network transactions can give an estimate of total network activity. The inflation percentage is the amount of new KUJI tokens created over time and is also a measure of existing token holder dilution. Kujira has no inflation and the inflation percentage is always 0%.

Wallet

The wallet tab has several useful features, including the ability to:

* Create new vesting contracts for any token on the Kujira blockchain
* Send token balances to other wallets
* Display the amount of each of your Kujira token balances and your overall token dollar balance
* Display your total amount of staked KUJI
* Allow for the auto-conversion of user-selected assets on the Kujira blockchain to KUJI.

#### Creating Vesting Contracts

#### Auto-convert Assets to KUJI

### Swap

This tab is a lite interface for performing a simple swap between any tokens. This is accomplished by placing [FIN](fin/) market orders behind the scenes. Swaps are currently limited to [FIN](fin/) market pairs. To trade between two assets without a direct [FIN](fin/) pair, you can first trade for [USK](usk-stablecoin.md) or axlUSDC as necessary, depending on the target asset using the BLUE swap UI. At most, you may need to make up to 3 trades.

### IBC / Bridge

The IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) / Bridge tab is where you can connect to other networks and transfer assets between them.

### Mint

The Mint tab is where you can mint [USK](usk-stablecoin.md), which is a stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar.

### Stake

### Govern

#### Senate

#### Chain Governance
