# ðŸ”¢ Basics

## Overview

This section will cover various basics of navigating the ORCA user interface including basic types of ORCA markets and using Sea Shanty, a helpful tool that enhances the ORCA experience.

## ORCA Markets

There are currently two types of ORCA markets in the works: lending markets and perpetual markets. Perpetuals markets are currently under development. All available ORCA markets can be seen on the main landing page [https://orca.kujira.app](https://orca.kujira.app).

In the future, once cross-chain markets launch, there will be further differentiation between Kujira native lending markets and cross-chain lending markets. ORCA has been redesigned for the Kujira blockchain to bring decentralized community liquidations to all EVM and RUST based projects increasing accessibility and fairness for everyone.

Each landing page ORCA market displays information about the collateral type being bidded on, the denomination bids can be made in, the market type, the total value locked in the market that can be bid on, the total amount of current ORCA bid liquidity for that market, the max possible discount via ORCA for that market, and the total sum of an individual's currently active bids for that market.

At the moment, only lending markets are available on ORCA, specifically [USK](../../usk-stablecoin.md) lending markets for liquidating collateral used to back USK and for isolated FIN margin.

There are two main types of ORCA markets:

* [Lending Markets](lending-markets/)
* Perpetuals Markets (currently under development)

#### SeaShanty

SeaShanty is a very helpful 3rd party tool that can be used across various Kujira decentralized applications, not only ORCA. It is recommended to interact with the Sea Shanty application on Telegram in order to download and register one's account with it. In this way, it is able to provide alerts about filled liquidation bids, filled FIN orders, USK collateral risk of liquidation, and auto-activate ORCA bids--a necessary step to be able to actually purchase liquidated collateral via ORCA at a discount.
