# ðŸ”Ž FINDER

FINDER is the Kujira Network's official 1st party blockchain explorer. An important piece of blockchain infrastructure,  Finder's webpage allows you to track addresses, transactions, validators and more, on Kujira.&#x20;

FINDER can be used on both mainnet and testnet. The majority of users probably want to use mainnet exclusively. However, developers may get a lot of benefit out of using FINDER on testnet to verify transactions and track other useful information. The desired network can be toggled in the upper right corner.

Multiple addresses can be bookmarked and named simply by searching for them and then clicking on the bookmark sign in the upper righthand corner. These saved addresses correspond to your cookies so you may need to recreate them if you delete your local cookies.

To view saved addresses you can click the bookmark button directly beside the search bar.&#x20;
